## Definition
Docker is an open-source platform that simplifies application deployment by using containers. Containers package an application and all its dependencies, ensuring consistent performance across various environments. Unlike virtual machines, Docker containers are lightweight as they share the host system's OS, making them more efficient. Docker enhances portability, scalability, and reliability, enabling seamless application development and deployment.
