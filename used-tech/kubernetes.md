## Definition
Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It orchestrates multiple containers across a cluster of machines, ensuring efficient resource use, load balancing, and high availability. Kubernetes simplifies complex container operations like scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing by automatically managing container lifecycles.

## Testing
You can test your YAML files with with [Minikube](#minikube).

## Minikube
Minikube is a tool that allows you to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally on your machine. It's primarily used for development and testing purposes, making it easy to experiment with Kubernetes without needing a full-scale cloud setup. Minikube provides a simplified way to learn and test Kubernetes features in a local environment.
