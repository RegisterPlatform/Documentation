## Definition
Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management solution. It provides features such as single sign-on (SSO), user authentication, authorization, and user management for applications. Keycloak supports various authentication mechanisms like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML, enabling secure and centralized management of users and roles across multiple applications. It also offers features like user federation, social login, and integration with external identity providers, making it ideal for managing authentication and authorization in large-scale, distributed systems.

## Development Setting
You can start keycloak in developer mode for testing your application. You can run it in development with some commands
```shell
start-dev
```
To run it in production you should use the command
```shell

```
