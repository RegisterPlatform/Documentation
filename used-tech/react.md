## Definition
React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. Developed by Facebook, it enables developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently update and render as data changes. React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering performance and is focused on building fast, scalable, and interactive front-end applications. It is widely used for developing modern web applications with a component-based architecture.
